# Dice-Game
A simple dice guessing game

## About

In this game, the user will guess a number from one to 6.  A dice will roll and the user's guess will be compared.  Can you last up to three strikes?

### Rules

You must guess what number the computer is going to roll.  If you guess correctly, you win the game.  Otherwise, if you guess incorrectly, a strike is given and you can continue to guess.  If you reach three strikes, the game is over.  Guessing correctly will remove up to two of your strikes.  Good luck!
